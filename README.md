# Arduino_LEDs_PhotoInturruptSensors
I have 8 LEDs and 2 photomicrosensors (right and left sensor) connected to Arduino Uno. All the 8 LEDs start in an off state, then when the right sensor is interrupted all LEDs are turned on and off at once, and when the Left sensor is interrupted then LEDs start blinking one after another
