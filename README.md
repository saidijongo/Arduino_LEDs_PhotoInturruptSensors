# Arduino_LEDs_PhotoInturruptSensors
I have 8 LEDs and 2 photomicrosensors (right and left sensor) connected to Arduino Uno. All the 8 LEDs start in an off state, then when the right sensor is interrupted all LEDs are turned on and off at once, and when the Left sensor is interrupted then LEDs start blinking one after another.This is just to determine whether sensors are interrupted or not
In the circuit design, I have connected power terminals (+ve & -ve) of the photomicro sensors on the breadboard, while the sensors' Comm terminals are connected to the level 5-3.3V level shifter. Breadboard is connected to an external 5V DC source, that is used to power sensors and providing a 5V reference to the level shifter. 3.3V reference voltage of the level shifter is provided directly from the Arduino board. 
Also every LED's negative terminal is connected to the breadboard's negative rail and the longer leads are connected to 220ohm resistors which all the way to the Arduino board.
